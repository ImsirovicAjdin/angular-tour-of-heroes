Display a Heroes List

In this page, you'll expand the Tour of Heroes app to display a list of heroes, and allow users to select a hero and display the hero's details.

Create mock heroes
You'll need some heroes to display.

Eventually you'll get them from a remote data server. For now, you'll create some mock heroes and pretend they came from the server.

Create a file called mock-heroes.ts in the src/app/ folder. Define a HEROES constant as an array of ten heroes and export it. The file should look like this.
`.`

Displaying heroes
You're about to display the list of heroes at the top of the HeroesComponent.

Open the HeroesComponent class file and import the mock HEROES.
`.`

In the same file (HeroesComponent class), define a component property called heroes to expose HEROES array for binding.

https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt2#list-heroes-with-ngfor

List heroes with *ngFor
Open the HeroesComponent template file and make the following changes:

Add an <h2> at the top,
Below it add an HTML unordered list (<ul>)
Insert an <li> within the <ul> that displays properties of a hero.
Sprinkle some CSS classes for styling (you'll add the CSS styles shortly).
Make it look like this:
`.`

The *ngFor is Angular's repeater directive. It repeats the host element for each element in a list.

In this example

<li> is the host element
heroes is the list from the HeroesComponent class.
hero holds the current hero object for each iteration through the list.
Don't forget the asterisk (*) in front of ngFor. It's a critical part of the syntax.

After the browser refreshes, the list of heroes appears.
